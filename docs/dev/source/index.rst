Welcome to Open-Subs Developers documentation!
===================================================

Open Subs's aim is allowing israelies elect candidates rather than
parties. The project is AngularJS_ at the front and Python_ and 
Flask_ at the back.

Some useful project links:

* The Mockup_
* The `drive folder`_
* `Our code repository`_
* `The issue tracker`_ (bugs, tasks etc.)
* The `forum thread`_
* `Hasadna`_ site (our parent organization)
