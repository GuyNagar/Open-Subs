Welcome to Open-Subs Developers documentation!
===================================================

Open Subs's lets commoners elect a team chair persons and ladies
for the committees of the house of commons.

The game is based on an Israeli road trip trick where you urgently wake
a friend in the middle him of the night, telling him that all
the friends are drawning and asks him "Where are the submarine keys?"

In Level I, you need to construct the key. The key has 11 teeth, each
representing an committe chair. The player is led teeth-by-teeth, electing
his representitve in each committee.

In Level II you unlock your sub and drive it in a defender_ style arcade.

The project is is purely javascript and the forntend is AngularJS_.
