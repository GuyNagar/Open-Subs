Welcome to Open-Subs Developers documentation!
===================================================

Open Subs's lets commoners elect a team of chair persons
for the committees of the house of commons.

The game plot is based on a high school road trip trick where you urgently wake
a friend in the middle of the night, telling him that your friends
are drawning and asks him "Where are the submarine keys?"

In Level I, you need to construct the key. The key has 11 teeth, each
representing a committe chair, i.e. first tooth is the head of
the *Finance and Services Committee*. The player is led teeth-by-teeth, electing
his representitve for each committee.

The project is is purely javascript and the forntend is AngularJS_.
